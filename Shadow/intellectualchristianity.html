      <h2 class='heading'>Is Christianity Intellectual?</h2>
      <article>
        Many people tell me that they are too logical to accept Christianity. They think that their "rational nature" or their "engineering background" makes them unable to "let go of logical thinking", and that they just can't sit with the logical inconsistencies they see in Christianity because of this. <br><br>

At this point in the convsersation, many Christians naturally feel obliged to explain and resolve these logical inconsistencies. However, I argue that such a response is not only ineffective, but harmful <br><br>

In this essay, I argue that Christians are not only ineffective, but that they are actively harming the Christian faith by trying to refute logical criticisms of Christianity.<br><br>

Fr. Gheorghe Calciu quote <br>
Jazz quote <br><br>

Because in those cases (movies, deep personal conversations, music, art in general), there is a clear expectation that the conversation you’re about to have is not about what's logical.<br><br>

But Christianity fails to set that expectation properly. The problem with Christianity in the West is that it is a non-logical conversation that’s pretending to be logical.<br><br>

Christians feel like they have to win the logical battleground in order to be taken seriously as a religion nowadays. So they come up with all kinds of weird ways to rationalize their faith, or to redefine their faith in logical terms.<br><br>

Incidentally, what we overwhelmingly see on the debate stage is Christians arguing for their faith mainly using these artificial logical justifications, as if the faith is built on this logic. <br><br>

No, Christianity does not begin with this. It never was based on these logical justifications. Christianity didn’t emerge because it finally explained the trees and the animals better than all the religions before it. Christianity didn’t prove itself by its superior cosmology or history of the world. That’s not why people followed Jesus, and that’s not what Jesus’ church is about either. Finally, Christ wasn’t a better logician than the pharisees — in fact, he criticized the pharisees for the strictness of their logic.<br><br>

All this logic is PERIPHERAL, not central, to Christianity. But in modern western debates, logic is front and centre, in the spotlight: “we are here to argue facts and logic”. <br><br>

But in all these major debates we see Christians participate in in the West. So these Christian debaters we see on stage are not speaking the essence of Christianity. <br><br>

All this logic around Christianity ad hoc — they all emerged out of a need for Christianity to defend itself against logical criticisms of its cosmology.<br><br>

Trying to justify the logic in Christianity is like explaining an abstract movie. It’s just autistic and misses the point.<br><br>

But Christians are afraid to admit that. Or they actually don’t know.
