      <article>
        The thing that is stopping people from being reflective is being disorganized.<br><br>

When a baby is learning how to walk, he is always thinking about walking while walking — he cannot count or chew gum at the same time because attention is a limited resource. More stuff is only unlocked once walking is on autopilot.<br><br>

In the same way, if your life is a mess, then your mind is always occupied with the basics like what to do next, what to eat, how to dress, where your stuff is, etc. Where is the time (and the energy!) to be reflective in the midst of all this? You must put all that on autopilot.<br><br>

The basic aspects of life aren't for you to always be handling. You might not think these things are a big deal, but pay attention and you may find that this is your life.<br><br>

And besides, you've been given an amazingly powerful and adaptable brain — even the height of our technology is still at its feet. Isn't it a shame and a huge waste for such a fantastic machine to be busied with menial jobs? It's like having a PhD count inventory!<br><br>

So if you really want to take your machine for a spin, you have to be serious about putting the most basic aspects of your life on autopilot. That means having an organized room do the rummaging for you, having a calendar keep track of events for you, having some kind of routine do the daily planning for you, etc.<br><br>

If you don't put the basic aspects of your life on autopilot, you will always be thinking about the same things every day, always wanting to run away from this mess, and always walking in place.<br><br>
