Have you ever heard someone unironically ask <i>why</i> they should care about other people?<br><br>

I have, and it really grinded my gears. And clearly, so has <a href='https://www.huffpost.com/entry/i-dont-know-how-to-explain-to-you-that-you-should_b_59519811e4b0f078efd98440'>this guy</a> who was so riled up about it that he wrote an entire article titled ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to explain to you that you should care about other people‚Äù:<br><br>

  <p>"There are all kinds of practical, self-serving reasons to raise the minimum wage[,] fund public schools[,] and make sure every American can access health care[.] <b>But if making sure your fellow citizens can afford to eat, get an education, and go to the doctor isn‚Äôt enough of a reason to fund those things, I have nothing left to say to you</b>."</p><br><br>

Let's not get bogged down in the writer's political points. I want to talk about the sentiment that this exerpt captures so well:<br><br>

<div class='huge'>"If only people weren't so selfish"</div><br>

Almost everyone agrees that selfishness is a big problem, if not the only problem. Well, you might think that "greed is good" type capitalists see no problem with selfish greed; but even among these people, you will not find many who are indifferent about the way Martin Shkreli <a href='https://www.npr.org/2022/05/19/1100019063/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-been-released-from-prison'>cashed in the livelihood of many sick Americans and their families</a>, for example.<br><br>

(If you don't know about the Shkreli scandal, here's a rundown: he bought the rights to some life-saving drug in order to tremendously jack up the drug's price, knowing that the ill would pay him anything for the medicine they need. Thus, many Americans who could no longer afford it died while many others broke their families' savings for the treatment, and Shkreli made a üí∞killingüí∞ off it.)<br><br>

And from the look on his face during his congressional testimony, Shkreli is very proud of his brilliant scheme.<br><br>

What do you even do with a guy like this? Sit him down and tell him what he did is wrong?<br><br>

There's nothing you can do to him. You could punch him in the face, but that would be for your own satisfaction more than anything.<br><br>

<b>We do not know how to deal with this</b>.<br><br>

Shkreli's indifference is what leaves me speechless. But this speechlessness is more than just the result of not knowing what to say to this guy: it is a mouth gaping at the reality that this kind of evil can even exist.<br><br>

Now, I will 

<h2 style='text-align: left;font-size: 200%;'>How to Deal With the Indifference</h2>

So, what do you say when you‚Äôre faced with someone who just doesn‚Äôt care? If you try to come up with a good answer, you will notice that it‚Äôs tricky. We do not normally have to tell people to care about others ‚Äî people seem to inherently care. Who can stand to see someone in pain and not wish to help? It looks like <u>we don‚Äôt need a reason to help, we just want to</u>, just like we want food, security, or pretty things.<br><br>

But our problem here is that there seems to be people who don‚Äôt have that want ‚Äî conservatives, according to the linked post. But let's borrow the word "psychopath" as a placeholder for people who do not inherently care about others.<br><br>

Now, is there psychopaths would not be a problem if it could be resolved by sending them a zesty WikiHow article titled "How to give a damn.‚Äù But unfortunately, that question tends to stump people: they always give weak answers like ‚Äúbeing selfless makes you happier‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôd like it if others were selfless.‚Äù The first answer is a cop-out not only because it‚Äôs not always true, but because, fundamentally, acting selflessly is not about how much you personally benefit from acting that way; that‚Äôs just selfishness in disguise. The second answer is ineffective because it appeals to empathy, but <u>psychopaths do not lack empathy</u>. Psychopaths have the ability to know how others feel, it‚Äôs just that <u>they do not care about pain that is not theirs</u>. <br><br>

Is there any great argument we can give to get them to care? Or are we only kept in line by the pangs of our conscience, the fear of falling out of line, and maybe a lust for heroism?<br><br>

Is Raskolnikov correct in saying that we only stay in line out of cowardice, not love? Are psychopaths just radically honest, brave individuals who overcame fear and escaped the matrix?<br><br>

After all, what <i>would</i> motivate someone who has shed off all fear and guilt to care about others? Is there anything left? What is it? That is the question.
